You want me to help you plan the initial implementation of \"HomeBase Pro,\" a React Native + Expo 54 mobile app that connects homeowners with service providers. You've provided detailed specifications for the app's features, roles (Provider and Homeowner), tech stack, brand tokens, and implementation order. You're aiming for a beautiful layout and UX/UI with liquid glass React Native iOS features and floating icons and widgets.\n\nHere's a plan for the first version of the app, focusing on core features and a visually appealing design:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Onboarding and Auth:** Implement the initial authentication flow (signup, login) with role selection (Provider/Homeowner). This will lay the foundation for personalized experiences.\n*   **Provider Profile Setup:** Enable providers to set up their business profiles, including business information, services offered, and Stripe Connect integration for payment processing.\n*   **Homeowner Marketplace (Basic):** Create a simplified marketplace where homeowners can browse and filter providers. Implement a basic booking flow.\n*   **Dashboards:** Create basic dashboards for both providers and homeowners. The provider dashboard should display today's jobs, unpaid invoices, and weekly revenue. The homeowner dashboard should display upcoming appointments and my providers.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#050505`\n    *   Glass Surface: `rgba(255,255,255,0.05)` with `backdrop-blur`\n    *   Primary Green: `#0FAF6E`\n    *   Dark Green: `#083322`\n    *   Accent Cyan: `#00F0FF`\n    *   Text: White or very light gray for readability against the dark background.\n    *   TextSecondary: A slightly darker shade of gray for less important text.\n    *   Card: Use the Glass Surface color for cards to create a frosted glass effect.\n    *   Highlight: Accent Cyan for interactive elements and important information.\n*   **Typography:** Modern, clean sans-serif fonts that are easy to read on mobile devices.\n*   **Liquid Glass and Floating Elements:** Implement liquid glass effects using React Native libraries that support blur and transparency. Use floating icons and widgets to add a modern and interactive feel.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\n**Plan for the Coding Agent:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Ensure the project is set up with React Native, Expo 54, TypeScript, and any necessary UI libraries for liquid glass effects and floating elements.\n2.  **Navigation:** Implement basic tab navigation for switching between the Provider and Homeowner views.\n3.  **Authentication:** Implement the authentication flow using Supabase Auth. Create signup and login screens with role selection.\n4.  **Data Models:** Define TypeScript interfaces for Provider and Homeowner profiles, services, bookings, and other relevant data.\n5.  **UI Components:** Create reusable UI components for buttons, inputs, cards, and other elements, styled according to the specified color palette and design principles.\n6.  **Provider Profile Setup:** Create a screen where providers can enter their business information, services, and connect to Stripe.\n7.  **Homeowner Marketplace:** Implement a basic marketplace screen where homeowners can browse providers.\n8.  **Dashboards:** Create basic dashboards for both providers and homeowners, displaying relevant information.\n\nFinally, remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-05T23:37:25.081215"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the HomeBase Pro app!
